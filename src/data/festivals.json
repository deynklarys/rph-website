			"\"Burunyog\" is an old Bikolano word meaning united. Combined with “Niyog” (coconut), it forms “Buruniyogan,” a unique celebration highlighting the benefits of coconuts. Nearly every part of the coconut is usable, making Buruniyogan distinctive with its four key impacts: Environmental Preservation & Tourism Promotion, Agricultural Development, Economic Growth, and Cultural and Heritage Preservation.",
			"The festival is inspired by the unity of Our Lady of Sorrows of Batong Paloway and St. Andrew the Apostle. \"Niyog\", the tree of life, brings us together in San Andres, Catanduanes, showcasing the town’s offerings. \"Calolbon ang hinarian! San Andres na ngonian! Mara na sa BuruNIYOGan\" (Calolbon was the past! Now it’s San Andres! Come to Buruniyogan)."
